				<h2>PROPER DISPOSAL OF LITHIUM POLYMER BATTERIES</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Lithium Polymer (LiPo) batteries are a 
				serious safety concern for hobbyists. Especially, once they have been 
				cycled so many times or are victim to a crash and begin to puff up. 
				If your LiPo appears puffy or can’t seem to hold a charge anymore, 
				it’s time to dispose of it. You can’t simply throw it in your trash 
				can, a fire could start immediately. You must go through a procedure 
				of safely discharging the battery to 0.0V and taking the discharged 
				battery to a proper disposal center.</p>
				<h3 style="text-align:left;">Discharging a LiPo battery safely</h3>
				<p style="text-align:left;">First item of concern is getting an unstable 
				LiPo down to holding no charge at 0.0V. This is done by giving the battery 
				a load to work across until all charge has been expelled. Here are some 
				separate methods of accomplishing that. </br></br>A note before going over 
				different methods it to be sure that you discharge your LiPos in a safe 
				location, preferably outside in a location that is somewhat heat resistant. 
				I personally use an old 30 cal. ammo can with air ventilation (Some people 
				call this a battery bunker). However, you can use a LiPo safe bag or a 
				cinder block chamber, anything that will prevent a fire from spreading 
				should a LiPo burst into flames.</p>
				<h3 style="text-align:left;">Using the discharger on a battery charger</h3>
				<p style="text-align:left;">Many battery charges on the market today have a 
				discharge function. Making it a simple as setting the battery charger function 
				to “Discharge” and setting the current to a low 0.5A-1.0A (No rush, the LiPo is 
				most likely already very unstable).</br></br>Most of these chargers however 
				will not discharge the battery completely. It will bring the battery down to 
				a minimum voltage, but not bring it down so low that it would, under normal 
				circumstances, cause damage to the LiPo.</br></br>Your charger will tell you 
				that these batteries are dead however verify this with a multimeter. If the 
				meter does not read 0.0V then try one of the other methods to discharge the 
				battery 100%.</p>
				<h3 style="text-align:left;">Using a halogen lightbulb or high wattage resistor</h3>
				<p style="text-align:left;">The idea to discharge the battery is to give the battery 
				a load to work across and send its coulombs to work. You can make a discharger of your 
				own by giving the battery a dummy load to work with whether that be a halogen lightbulb 
				or a resistor. I prefer using a halogen lightbulb because the light that the bulb emits 
				is an excellent visual indicator of remaining charge. If the lightbulb is on, there is 
				charge. If the lightbulb is off, no charge.</br></br>The reason for a halogen bulb is 
				due to the fact that the bulb is very inefficient, it will use up charge much faster 
				than anything else. Using an LED as the load will only draw about 200mA depending on 
				the LED used, too efficient!</br></br>A 12V 20W bulb will suffice but be aware that 
				the battery is going to get very hot during this process.</br></br>The lightbulb 
				discharger is constructed by connecting an XT-60 connector (or whichever connector you 
				use) to the leads of a halogen lightbulb. Of course, be sure positive goes to 
				positive and ground goes to ground. I would not solder directly to leads of the bulb. 
				This will work but to make it easier to replace the bulb I used a G4 socket meant for 
				halogen bulbs like the one used.</br></br>This setup should be good for LiPos up to 
				3S and 4S and you can add more lights in parallel to increase the draw.</br></br>One 
				that’s all build just plug in your LiPo to the connector and wait till the bulb goes 
				out. Once it’s out verify that the charge is 0.0V with a multimeter and there you go! 
				Simple. As previously stated, the discharge process will get hot so be sure you are 
				discharging in a safe, heat resistant location.</p>
				<h3 style="text-align:left;">Discharging in a salt water bath</h3>
				<p style="text-align:left;">This is a different method for discharging where you 
				completely submerge your battery in a solution of water and salt (Ratio of water 
				to salt is about 10:1). This process will take much longer then any other and I do 
				not personally recommend it, however, it deserved to be mentioned for its popularity.</p>
				<h3 style="text-align:left;">Putting a nail through the battery</h3>
				<p style="text-align:left;">This is an old rumor. DO NOT DO THIS!</p>
				<h3 style="text-align:left;">Discarding of the empty battery</h3>
				<p style="text-align:left;">Now that the battery is discharged completely 
				and reads 0.0V on a multimeter, you can now dispose of the battery. Some people 
				save the connectors and solder the two leads of the battery together to ensure 
				that any minute remaining charges is gone.</br></br>You have options of where to 
				take your dead batteries:</br></br><b>Take to a hobby shop</b></br>Some hobby shops will 
				have a place for discharged LiPos where they will later properly dispose of.</br>
				</br><b>Take to a disposal center</b></br>Check your city’s website about this one. 
				It is not uncommon for the task of battery disposal to be contracted to a store 
				or junkyard.</br></br><b>Put it in the trash</b></br>Express extra caution with this one. 
				Check all relevant laws in your area before putting your LiPo in the trash.</p>

				<p>Here's the discharge bulb I have set up. This along with the battery are kept in an ammo 
				can in the event the discharge results in an explosion.</p>
