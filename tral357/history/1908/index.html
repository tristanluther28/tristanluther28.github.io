                        In the morning of June 30th, 1908 an unprecedented event would occur at the Tunguska site. 
                        An explosion the measured to be as powerful as 15-30 Megatons occurred in the Siberian Taiga 
                        (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103518304676?via%3Dihub">Wheeler, 2019</a>). This explosion is the energy equivalent to 1000 times the energy of the 
                        nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The explosion flattened 830 sq. miles of forested lands. 
                        Destroying an estimated 80 million trees (<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/rock-samples-suggest-meteor-caused-tunguska-blast-1.13163">Peplow, 2013</a>). Had this explosion occurred in a 
                        major city it would have taken it off the map.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        The explosion was detected at seismic station worldwide, as far as Washington D.C. Even illuminating the 
                        sky over Europe for some days after the explosion (<a href="https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qj.49706025709">Whipple, 1934</a>). The source of the explosion was not 
                        known for most of the 20th century. The only theory on how such a monstrous explosion could occur was a
                         meteoroid about 500 feet wide at low speed struck the earth. However, this report was unconfirmed until 
                         a 2013 report (<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/rock-samples-suggest-meteor-caused-tunguska-blast-1.13163">Peplow, 2013</a>). In fact, the Russian government did not send anyone to investigate the 
                         explosion until 1921. Mostly due to the isolation of the area (<a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/30jun_tunguska">Phillips, 2008</a>).

                        The accounts from the Evenki clans in the area describe a violent punishment from their gods. One account that 
                        encapsulates what this event must have been like. From a S. Semenov “The split in the sky grew larger, and the 
                        entire northern side was covered with fire. At that moment I became so hot that I couldn't bear it as if my 
                        shirt was on fire; from the northern side, where the fire was, came strong heat. I wanted to tear off my shirt 
                        and throw it down, but then the sky shut closed, and a strong thump sounded, and I was thrown a few meters. I 
                        lost my senses for a moment, but then my wife ran out and led me to the house. After that such noise came, as 
                        if rocks were falling or cannons were firing, the Earth shook, and when I was on the ground, I pressed my head 
                        down, fearing rocks would smash it. When the sky opened up, hot wind raced between the houses, like from cannons, 
                        which left traces in the ground like pathways, and it damaged some crops. Later we saw that many windows were 
                        shattered, and in the barn, a part of the iron lock snapped.” (<a href="http://tunguska.tsc.ru/ru/science/1/0">Kulik, 1930</a>).
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        Mystery surrounded the event due to the lack of an impact crater, making the event the subject of countless scientific studies. Which is what eventually led to its main purpose 
                        as a protected area, to be a research station to study the effects of a meteorite impact on a nature preserve. 
                        However, it was not established as a protected area until 1995.
