				<h2>MOUSE DROID (MSE-6)</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Hi all! Here’s the build log for my MSE-6 Repair Droid. Better 
				known as a Mouse Droid. The thing that really possessed me to build 
				this up was seeing the wonderful scale R2-D2 builds by plenty of the 
				members over at <a href="http://astromech.net">astromech.net</a> really great work seen over there. That 
				with a mix of having a hobby in electronics design and being a mild Star 
				Wars fan, I figured a smaller scale droid would be suitable for a first 
				build.</p>
				<p><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/projects/mse/mse2.jpg" hspace="20" alt="mse" style="float:right;border: ridge 2px black;"></p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">Also, I wouldn’t have been able to get this 
				done without all of the help from build logs featured on <a href="https://forum.mousedroidbuilders.club/index.php">mousedroidbuilders.club</a>, 
				thank you to everyone who posts there. Now onto my build.</p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">My build started out with me getting a Traxxis 
				Bandit RC Car at a discounted price on eBay. The Bandit was the RC typically 
				used around the club for those who were trying to build the droid on the cheap. 
				The Bandit came with its own battery and transmitter making it convenient for 
				anyone who is not already involved in RC vehicles. The stock outer shell and 
				spoiler were removed and discarded, as they would not be used in any part of 
				the build. The stock Bandit ran off a Nickel Cadmium (NiCad) battery, which 
				I found unimpressive. A Lithium Battery will most likely replace this in 
				the future.</p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">Now that I had a chassis to work with, I knew that 
				I wanted something relatively lightweight. As the Bandit chassis and motor 
				wouldn’t be able to carry anything too extreme. I had seen many R2 units that 
				were machined from Aluminum and Mouse Droid frames made from milled 2x4s; 
				materials that were going to be too heavy for the RC chassis that was picked 
				out. I also had a 3D printer at my disposal, thanks to the local library, so 
				I knew that 3D printed parts would be an option also thanks to TinyP’s post 
				with .stl files of mouse droid parts.</p>
				<p><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/projects/mse/mse3.jpg" hspace="25" alt="mse" style="float:left;border: ridge 2px black;"></p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">These circumstances led me to the decision to make 
				the frame out of ABS printed with ~60% infill (This was overkill). Also (special 
				thanks to the club for this) a plastics manufacturing company called Granite 
				Earth has an ABS mold that, with a few cuts, looks just like the form of a Mouse 
				Droid. Using ABS would also allow it to be supported by the frame and chassis.</p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">Next order of business was the side IC panels. Already 
				being an electronics hobbyist, this was able to be done with no additional costs. 
				Looking at a picture for reference, I lined up about 120+ IC chips to form the 
				side panels. For the record, the IC chip I used were NAND 7404 (they will be 
				remembered for their sacrifice).</br>With all of the parts either, printed, 
				arrived or on-standby, it was time to put it all together!</br>I started by 
				placing the frame, now assembled together, inside of the uncut shell. The frame 
				was glued into place and dried overnight.</br>With the frame down, it was time 
				to cut the ridge of the shell to shape. Using a rotary tool, I carved around both 
				sides of the shell until it was level with the in-place frame.</br>Next was to 
				place the chassis, the chassis fit rather nicely in the bottom shell and once it was 
				in place I marked the places where the tires would stick out and cut the holes. 
				Again, these were cut with the rotary tool.</p>
				<p><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/projects/mse/mse8.jpg" hspace="20" alt="mse" style="float:right;border: ridge 2px black;"></p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">The droid was starting to come together and now that I 
				had the bottom attached to the chassis I went to see how it ran. There was a problem, 
				the chassis was not supporting the weight of the ABS and the bottom sagged to the 
				point where the bottom frame was dragging along. I found the cause of this to be 
				the suspension on the chassis supporting the tires. The suspension’s shocks were 
				weighed down and lower the vehicle. To rectify this inserted some 3/8” PEX tubing 
				into the shocks to stiffen them out and not move at all. This worked! Kind of.</p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">The chassis was still sagging and when you added the top shell, the weight was 
				still too much for the chassis to support it. Also, the vehicle could not go over 
				simple cracks in the sidewalk without getting stich from the front end of the 
				bottom. What I needed to do was raise the front of the bottom shell to the chassis 
				and bring more support to the center bolts that were initially used to attach the 
				bottom shell to the chassis. This was accomplished by adding another bolt to the 
				frontmost part of the chassis and adding a support beam across the two front center 
				bolts. These support solutions rectified the problem and gave me clearance to 
				finish work on the top shell.</p>
				<p><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/projects/mse/mse11.jpg" hspace="20" alt="mse" style="float:left;border: ridge 2px black;"></p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">The top shell didn’t need much. I added a 3” hole on 
				both sides where I plan to place speakers so that the droid can have a voice and 
				threw the side panels and top greebles on. After giving everything a coat of black 
				spray paint, it was looking presentable.</br></br>There is more to go on this 
				project. It is essentially the frame for a robot, so upgrades are always something 
				I can do. More to come eventually!</p>
